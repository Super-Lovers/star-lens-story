## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

In Cosmic Relay you play as an unfortunate traveler trying to pick the right choices to make it out alive. "Right" being a relative term. You have to help your character survive through the dangerous space filled with pirates and aliens waiting just around the corner using just your screen and console.
