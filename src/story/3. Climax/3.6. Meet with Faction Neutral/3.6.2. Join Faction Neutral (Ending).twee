:: 3.6.2. Join Faction Neutral (Ending)

((for nikolay - this is the player talking))

So in the end, I joined them.
Honestly, it seemed like the only logical thing to do.
They helped me through thick and thin, and then offered me a place to stay and their friendship.

And the void of space is so lonely.

Now, I can be happy here.
