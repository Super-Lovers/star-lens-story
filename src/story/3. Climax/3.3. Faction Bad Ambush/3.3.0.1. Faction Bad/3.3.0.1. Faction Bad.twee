    \@@color:gray;>@@ Hello~
<</type>>
<<type 40ms skipkey "Control">>
    \@@color:gray;>@@ So, question. Why won't you die? We have been really trying to get you out of our way, but you just can't seem to get the memo.
<</type>>
<<type 40ms skipkey "Control">>
    \@@color:gray;>@@ It's getting really annoying.
<</type>>
<<type 40ms skipkey "Control">>
    \@@color:gray;>@@ Yes, yes, we know. You thought you could "trust us", but isn't it your own fault for trusting the first transmission your ship received?
<</type>>
<<type 40ms skipkey "Control">>
    \@@color:gray;>@@ And then again and again while you kept failing?
<</type>>
<<type 40ms skipkey "Control">>
    \@@color:gray;>@@ So, we have decided to take a more direct approach. Don't worry, we will make it just as painfull as you've been annoying.
<</type>>
<<type 40ms skipkey "Control">>
    \@@color:gray;>@@ Now sit tight, and wait for death.
