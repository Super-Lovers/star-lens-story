        Hey, we received your distress signal.

        We can‚Äôt come pick you up right now, but we can guide you somewhere safe.

        We know this area like the palms of our hands.

        And we have many hands.

        The local rescue team is pretty busy generally, and you are kind of far off from their station, so they won‚Äôt be able to help you right away.

<<timed 14s>>\
    <<type 40ms skipkey "Control">>\
        If you want, we are on the way to the rescue station, though. You should be able to reach us just fine and wait for them here. 
    <</type>>

<<timed 19s>>\
    <<type 40ms skipkey "Control">>\
        We are waiting for you.

        Now, there‚Äôs an asteroid belt on the way, and the rescue team usually tells travellers like you to take a detour, but that‚Äôs because y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know the trick to getting through. You can absolutely try on your own if you want, but if you want to make it, you should get in through the bottom layer of the belt. Much less asteroids there.

    Good luck. We will see you on the other side. If you survive.
