        Normally, we‚Äôd swoop right in and carry you to the station to help you with whatever, right? Except we are kinda spread thin right now. Some new group‚Äôs been looting travellers ‚Äòn shit, ruining everyone‚Äôs vibes.

        Now, I know your ship probs put you on the straightest path here but, you‚Äôre gonna have to take a detour. There‚Äôs like a massive asteroid belt on the way and there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre gonna make it, so you‚Äôre gonna have to take the long way ‚Äòround through the X-2453 pathway.
